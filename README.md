# RiskTerrainModeling
## using Vision-based and Machine Learning techniques.
<p align="center">
The purpose of the current project is to design a function that maps the depth
information from a RGB-D camera to a risk heatmap of the camera scene and then, trains a Neural
Network to learn the mapping designed function to the risk heatmap given the camera data
(case a. input:Depth, case b. input:RGB), in order to perform in real-time since the analytical
computation of the function is time-consuming.
